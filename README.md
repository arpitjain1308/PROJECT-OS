Next-Gen OS Authentication: Face Recognition Login
Overview
This project implements a Next-Gen OS Authentication Model using Face Recognition for secure and seamless login on Linux systems. The system replaces traditional password-based authentication with biometric authentication, enhancing security and user convenience.

Features
Face Recognition Login: Uses a pre-trained face recognition model to authenticate users.

Seamless Integration: Works at the OS level to enable automatic login without a password.

Secure and Fast: Provides a reliable and efficient authentication system.

Customizable: Can be trained with multiple images for improved accuracy.

Installation
Step 1: Install Dependencies
Ensure your system has the required dependencies installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip libopencv-dev build-essential cmake g++ libssl-dev
Step 2: Install Face Recognition and Required Libraries
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python dlib face_recognition numpy
Step 3: Clone the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/face-authentication.git
cd face-authentication
Step 4: Register Your Face
Run the face registration script to store your facial data:

bash
Copy
Edit
python face_register.py
Step 5: Enable Face Recognition Login
Run the face login script to authenticate users via facial recognition:

bash
Copy
Edit
python face_login.py
Usage
The system captures your face using the webcam.

It compares the detected face with the stored facial data.

If the face matches, the system logs in automatically.

If authentication fails, the system falls back to password login.

Future Enhancements
Adding voice recognition as an additional authentication method.

Implementing multi-user face authentication.

Improving accuracy with deep learning models.
